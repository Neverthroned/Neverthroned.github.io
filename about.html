        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Yo, I'm Bridger, a current sophomore trying to get a bachelor's in media arts at the University of Montana. 
          I have a sister and two dogs, and am really happy to live in a super small town (that gets several feet of snow each year).
        </p>
        <p>
          I love art, drawing, anything that requires a canvasâ€”whether it be a physical or digital one. 
          I also love video games, and love to learn about the people who made them, as well as how they work. 
          I realized that media arts was the path for me if I wanted to make a career out of my passions, and that brings me to where I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, I can't wait to graduate, and am looking forward to the future. Here's to making more art!
