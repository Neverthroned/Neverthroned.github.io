        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Bridger, I'm a VFX artist who is experienced in game engines such as Unity and Unreal and the associated forms 
          of shader language and tools like shader graphs. I am capable of adding rendering features to the built in URP 
          (Unity Render Pipeline) and solidifying different rendering passes in order to produce stylized, and more 
          general lighting and render effects. I also have experience with tools such as the Adobe suite, Krita, and blender. 
          Given a reasonable amount of time, and an example or artist rendition, I can create a specific effect based in HLSL 
          and C# and bridge the gap between art and the technical limitations of a game engine.

        <p>
          I love every aspect of the game design process, and I just love games in general. Working on a team 
          or even independently to produce something to entertain people really brings me joy. Playing them myself to 
          is just as rewarding, and I love just messing around in engine to find the perfect balance of art and 
          code.
