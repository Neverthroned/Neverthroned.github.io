        <p><strong>Image 2:</strong> Noise can be applied in two different ways (in this instance), through a custom texture which can be attached to the tiling offset of the dither
            effect, or can be added to the final dither output, or it can be applied using a custom function. The top portion (noise texture) is the noise texture code, using a similar screen
            size scaler as the dither effect and tiling the desired noise texture. The middle portion (custom noise/function) takes an outside shader include file,
            or hlsl. This process also doesn't limit the function to be noise as hlsl files offer extreme flexibility, so it could be used for applying noise to a UV, or
            a custom time function that can add a transforming effect to your shader depending on where you put it.</p>

        <p><strong>Image 3:</strong> This is the custom hlsl file, currently configured to take an input of UVs, and output a float. This creates a white noise texture, which
            creates an interesting effect on screen, however its a smaller effect and not easily noticeable.</p>

        <p> This is a custom palette generator I made. Pxl Dev's video from the previous project offers the ability to input custom color palettes.
            The main issue though is that they generally need a larger amount of colors, up to 32x32. I haven't been able to locate any websites that offer this, so 
            I created a small generator with the ability to change gamma, saturation, and select two colors to act as the gradient. Originally they were only selectable by hue, 
            but now it's possible to have the gradient cycle between saturation and value. You can then download the image, and attach it to the palette section of 
            the shader and it will perform a color swap, creating an effect. This palette selection also allows for separate saturation layers, where you can 
            stack another 32x32 image creating a 32x64, and offering the color swap system a wider range of saturation and color values.</p>
