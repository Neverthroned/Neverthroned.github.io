      <p>A four person team working in Unreal on the Game Jam theme of mask. We made a bug extermination Game 
        doom-esque in style and gameplay with the ability to change masks which change your gameplay.

        <p>The game is a 3D, FPS, simulation with a horror artstyle made by Kaisha Gerhardt. 
          Dean Klakken worked on game development, programming, audio and level design. I worked on 
          game development, programming and audio.

        <p>My major contributions are the inventory system, basic enemy AI, an audio mixer, 
          the mask changing concept, and the main and pause menu.

        <p>The inventory was largely built from scratch, taking a framwork from a video and realizing that it wouldn't 
          work with our game. I then rebuilt it from the ground up to enable the switching slot by number like we wanted
          as well as incorporating the functionality with using items while they were in the slot. This 
          also required our team members to coordinate moving data between one system and another since we were working 
          on two separate laptops. A significant amount of time was spent on porting and adjusting the 
          inventory to work on my teammates laptop. Enemy AI was also 
          built from scratch using a simple pawn sensing node and move framework. Audio was simple and only required 
          making classes for the separate audio sounds, however the module wasn't able to be applied to the game before 
          it was uploaded, and as such the audio isn't adjustable like it should be. The mask changing module was
          made from complete scratch, requiring proper function between the inventory and it, implementation of changing 
          VFX within Unreal, and a stencil buffer to hide certain objects from the post processing (the latter option 
          wasn't fully implemented before the game was uploaded). Ultimately this project took a lot of coordination 
          and time management to get to work, not too mention staying up in the night to finish some of these systems.
