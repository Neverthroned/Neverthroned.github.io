        <p><strong>Image 1:</strong> This is the intended effect of the video, slightly modified with aberration, but largely based around pixelation and dithering.
        It uses a custom rednering setup, relying on a raw image to convey the current situation to the player and using the camera to output a render texture to
        that image, as well as the shader graph so that it can be manipulated.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="artifact-item">
        <img src="images/artifact3wodithering.png" alt="Artifact 3 image 2">
        <p><strong>Image 2:</strong> Without the dithering effect, it produces an effect not disimilar to found footage, or corrupted or low quality video files with the 
            harsh black outlines created through the edge mask and the pixelation and color quantization.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="artifact-item">
        <img src="images/artifact3main.png" alt="Artifact 3 image 3">
        <p><strong>Image 3:</strong> This is the main shader graph as described in the video, with some minor edits to support the Unity version and HDRP. It has capability
        to use custom palettes, bayer matrices, and differing resolutions. I'll refrain from going into detail as the author explains it better than I do.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="artifact-item">
        <img src="images/artifact3uvmain.png" alt="Artifact 3 image 4">
        <p><strong>Image 4:</strong> One of my additions was the UV section, orginally made to produce a more visible chromatic aberration effect, it instead creates a dark outline
        (based on the principles of chromatic aberration) which I think is more suitable for this specific video effect. The effect is created by getting the screen position UVs
        and manipulating them to fit into the custom camera setup described by the above video. This requires some math in order to get the right resolution on the effect
        as well as the right rotation and dimensions.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="artifact-item">
        <img src="images/artifact3uvsampler.png" alt="Artifact 3 image 5">
        <p><strong>Image 5:</strong> Once again, more math is needed to match the UVs to the screen size, and here we also see the sampling of those UVs before they
        are sent to the edge mask.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="artifact-item">
        <img src="images/artifact3edgemask.png" alt="Artifact 3 image 5">
        <p><strong>Image 6:</strong> Here is the edge mask, which creates the stylistic outlines portrayed more significantly in the image without dithering. This 
        effect is also visible with dithering, but is slightly different and produces a different stylistic effect.</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> My main additions to this were getting this to work in HDRP as opposed to URP, as well as downgrading the version it was housed in, from Unity 6 to
            Unity 2023. These additions were fairly straightforward and only involved negligble changes in syntax and camera setup, noticeably
            some of the assets were located in different areas, or under different names, this is most apparent with the render texture asset being located differently
            in Unity 6 as compared to my version, and some of the node settings in the shader graph needing to be changed to support HDRP. The other main addition was 
            the outline effect, having been created through similar methods as chromatic aberration. This took siginificantly more effort in order to get the effect 
            to line up correctly with the image, whether that be its rotation, orientation, or resolution. Ultimately, the edge mask and sampling was fairly straightforward 
            but getting the UVs to properly be incorporated in the image was extremely difficult and required repeated testing in order to function. Currently
            the effect is not in an ideal state, as the way the UVs are incorporated might interfere with other video effects, mainly due to the fact that by definition 
            the UVs are upside down in order to accomodate the raw image setup. This I feel can be alleviated through more testing and effort on my part, but for the time being 
            the effect works as intended and any changes would only help with future maintenance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> Why did I make these additions? This is largely due to my own selfish reasons of trying to get this to work in an older version of Unity and to have more control 
            with the settings offered by HDRP. I'm a devout fan of the dithering effect, and most other retro visual effects and it has always been a wish of mine to 
            get one of these to work. I have attempted to do so in the past, but all of these attempts led to failure. Having found this video by Pxl Dev gave me hope seeing as how 
            the Unity versions weren't incredibly far off, and likely wouldn't need too much in terms of changing assets in favor of compatability. Ultimately, I am 
            happy that the process wasn't largely different and I hope that some other developers might make of my documentation. As for why I added an aberration-like effect? 
            This was another effect I'm partial to, however it didn't come out in the way as intended. Yet, I'm still very happy with how it did turn out, and creates 
            an effect similar to low quality or old corrupted videos. I would like to create true chromatic aberration, but for now I'm more than happy having created 
            something I didn't really know was possible.
