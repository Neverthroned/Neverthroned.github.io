        The video above by <b>A Bit of Game Dev</b> demonstrates the implementation of a shader for an explosion 
        effect, which I appropriated in order to create a boss enemy themed around an Eye.

        <p><strong>Image 1:</strong> This is the first part of the effect, largely unmodified compared to the video 
        tutorial linked above. By taking a <b>noise texture</b> and applying a <b>fresnel effect</b> to it 
        you can create interesting VFX when applying the shader to a mesh. This section of the graph implements the 
        'dark color' of the effect, and in this case the Eye's outline. This section also is connected to an 
        <b>add node</b> to be combined with the light color and the <b>alpha</b> of the graph which allows for 
        transparency.</p>

        <p><strong>Image 2:</strong> This section of the graph is largely similar to the first section, with the only 
        differences being the power of the <b>fresnel effect</b> and the <b>saturate node</b>. This creates the 
        light color, or the pupil of the eye, and is linked to the <b>add node</b> from before and the 
        <b>emission</b> of the graph, allowing for a more pronounced light effect.</p>

        <img src="images/invection5/invection5noise1.png" alt="Invection 5 image 3">
        <p><strong>Image 3:</strong> The shader graph makes heavy usage of noise in order to achieve the desired 
        effect. The inner portion of the eye uses a standard noise texture plugged into both of the 
        <b>texture samples</b> from before, however the outer eye is a bit more complicated. For that I used a video 
        file created from <b>TouchDesigner</b> which required creating a <b>video player</b> object within the Unity 
        Editor. This <b>video player</b> would cast to a render texture to be applied to an identical shader graph 
        as before within those <b>texture samples</b>. This would create the animated effect I was looking for. 
        Within this image, I'm creating the first noise insert in <b>TouchDesigner</b> from scratch. That is to say 
        this is where I divert from the tutorial video's instructions.</p>

        <p><strong>Image 4:</strong> The previous noise insert is fed into this graph to to create several 
        <b>glitch effects</b>, though the most notable is what many would refer to as <b>circuit bending</b>. 
        After all of this, its fed into a movie file out to be used in Unity, more specifically to be implemented 
        into the <b>video player</b> object from before.</p>

        <p><strong>Final Render:</strong> The final effect renders a glitchy looking Eye, with an inner and outer shell</p>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While the video detailed using this practice in the form of an explosion 
          that also makes usage of the <b>Unity particle system</b> I opted to instead use the concept of the 
          <b>fresnel effect</b> in order to achieve a desirable VFX for a boss character. This required heavy 
          improvisation on my part in order to get this to properly work. Completely contrary to the video, I 
          instead wanted to create a standalone effect that would render an intimidating and unique boss, using outside 
          software such as <b>TouchDesigner</b> to get the noise effects I wanted. These noise effects would then be 
          integrated into the <b>video player</b> system to then be cast into a texture usable by the shader graph. 
          Ultimately, a lot of this is mainly about aesthetic choice, and manipulating what kind of surface the different 
          portions of the Eye should render as. The inner portion acting as a solid, opaque sphere with slight 
          <b>alpha clipping</b>, and the outer as a transparent object with largely opposing settings for 
          <b>dissolve</b> and <b>smoothstep</b>. The next steps for me would to integrate visual cues for when the eye 
          plans to attack by animating the integral settings.
